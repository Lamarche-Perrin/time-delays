# Time Delays

Time Delays is a digital installation. It has been developed and first displayed in June 2015 by Robin Lamarche-Perrin and Bruno Pace for the [eponymous dance festival](http://www.movingcells.org), in Leipzig.


## Installation on Linux

* Install OpenCV:
```
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
```

* Clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/Lamarche-Perrin/time-delays
```

* Compile the files:
```
cd time-delays
g++ -Wall -O3 -pthread time-delays.cpp -o time-delays `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv`
```

* Run the programs:
```
./time-delays <input>
```
where `<input>` is an optional parameter that is either
* the camera id you want to stream from (list devices with `v4l2-ctl --list-devices` once `v4l-utils` is installed)
* or the path to a video file you want to stream from.

If not specified, the application will try to open the webcam with id `0`.


### Control during execution

* `<Space>` to switch black screen on (or off)
* `<Escape>` to close the application
<br/><br/>

* `0` to suppress delay
* from `1` to `9` to set delay (from 15 frames to 135 frames, that is from 0.5 to 4.5 seconds in the case of 30fps)
* `+` to increase delay by 1
* `-` to decrease delay by 1
<br/><br/>

* `<Enter>` to switch heterogeneous delay on (or off)
* `h` to switch to horizontal delay
* `v` to switch to vertical delay
* `r` to reverse the direction of delay
* `s` to activate or deactivate symmetric delay
